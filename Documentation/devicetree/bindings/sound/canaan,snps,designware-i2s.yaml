title: Canaan DesignWare I2S Controller

maintainers:
	- Sun Xiaopeng <sunxiaopeng@canaan-creative.com>

description: |
	This document describes the device tree bindings for the Canaan DesignWare
	I2S controller found in the K230 SoC. The controller is compliant with the
	Synopsys DesignWare I2S IP core and requires specific properties to function
	correctly.

properties:
	compatible:
		const: "canaan,snps,designware-i2s"
		description: |
			Must be "canaan,snps,designware-i2s" to identify the Canaan-specific
			implementation of the DesignWare I2S controller.

	reg:
		maxItems: 1
		description: |
			Contains the base address and length of the I2S controller register set.

	status:
		enum:
			- "okay"
			- "disabled"
		description: |
			Standard property to enable or disable the device. Must be "okay" to
			activate the I2S controller.

	dmas:
		minItems: 2
		maxItems: 2
		description: |
			Phandles to the DMA channels for transmit and receive. The first item
			is for transmit (TX), and the second is for receive (RX).

	dma-names:
		items:
			- const: "tx"
			- const: "rx"
		description: |
			Names corresponding to the DMA channels listed in the "dmas" property.

	clocks:
		maxItems: 1
		description: |
			Phandle to the clock provided to the I2S controller.

	clock-names:
		items:
			- const: "i2sclk"
		description: |
			Name of the clock listed in the "clocks" property. Must be "i2sclk".

required:
	- compatible
	- reg
	- status
	- dmas

	- clocks
	- clock-names
